# SARIMA-Forecasting
Solar PV Waste Forecasting
Forecasting Solar E-Waste and Sustainable Recycling Solutions
Overview
This project is focused on forecasting solar e-waste in India and developing sustainable recycling systems using advanced time series forecasting methods like SARIMA and ARIMA. The goal is to predict trends in solar e-waste from the period of 2040 to 2055, contributing to better recycling solutions and waste management strategies for solar panels.

Research and Contributions
Solar E-Waste Forecasting: The project utilizes ARIMA and SARIMA modeling techniques to predict the growth of solar e-waste, accounting for a 25-year lifespan for solar panels.
Sustainable Recycling Strategies: In addition to forecasting, the project suggests ways to develop sustainable recycling systems to manage the anticipated increase in solar e-waste.
Study Area: The study focuses on India, where solar panel adoption is increasing rapidly, leading to significant amounts of solar e-waste in the future.
Methodology: We implemented a rolling window approach to improve the accuracy of the predictions. The project is based on the analysis of monthly solar panel installations data.

Key Features
Data: The project uses synthetic data on monthly solar panel installations (stored in synthetic_data.csv), which is used to estimate the solar e-waste generated over time.
Forecasting Model: The core of the project is the use of SARIMA to predict solar e-waste trends, with a focus on analyzing a 25-year lifespan for solar panels.
Visualization: Outputs include visual representations of solar e-waste forecasts, helping to visualize trends and future management needs.
